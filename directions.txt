RealtyCorp Slideshow

Difficulty Level: Medium

Technologies/skills used: Javascript/jQuery, CSS3, jQuery animation, CSS positioning



Problem Description:

RealtyCorp, a stylish new real estate broker, has hired you to finish building their website. The previous developer was more of a designer, really, so while the site looks decent, it's not quite done.

They would like you to build a professional-looking slideshow on the homepage to replace their list of images. They would like the slides to fade or scroll, depending on your preference.


Requreiments:


	1) In your CSS file, import the font the designer used in the designs using the @font-face directive.  You'll find the font file in the "css" folder.


	2) Something should happen when you hover over the menu links.
		2a) When the user hovers over a link, change that link's text color to #BFB895.
		2b) Add a half-second transition (make sure it works in Firefox and Webkit browsers, as well) for a nice effect.


	3) Right now the homepage has several images, which RealtyCorp would like turned into a slideshow. You can feel free to use any effects you like with this, whether it be side-scrolling or fading in/out, so long as the slideshow loops cleanly. The slides should change every five seconds.
		3a) You will likely need jQuery for this. Locate the jQuery source on Google's CDN and import it in your html file.
		3b) The address associated with each slide should be overlaid over the bottom of each slide. Give it a semi-transparent black background, but the text should be fully opaque.



	Hints:

	You should not need to use an explicit loop to accomplish the looping part of the slideshow. Look into Javascript functions that function as timers to help you.
